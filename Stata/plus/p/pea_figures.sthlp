{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{opt pea figures} generates a series of figures that are produced using the pea figures command in Stata for the convenience of the user. 
Figures span a broad range of topics, including a comparison of poverty rates and GDP per capita with other countries, changes in poverty and inequality over time, population composition by income decile, profiles, or exposure and risk from climate-related hazards.

{p 4 4 2}
The program supports a wide range of inputs, including national and PPP welfare and poverty lines, 
demographic variables, and survey metadata. Users can output results directly to an Excel file.

{p 4 4 2}
The program performs several data quality checks, including missing observations and weight 
verifications. It also ensures that the inputs meet the requirements for each figure type. 

{p 4 4 2}
Each figure is generated sequentially and saved to the specified Excel file or a temporary file.

{p 4 4 2}
The following figures are available within the {opt pea figures} command, each serving a distinct purpose. For more detailed explanations of their contents and usage, see below:{p_end}

{p 4 4 2}
{opt PPPPovlines(varlist numeric)}: specifies a list of PPP-adjusted poverty lines.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt PPPyear(integer)}: specifies which year PPPs are based on (e.g. 2017 or 2011). This is for example relevant for welfare measures from benchmark countries.
Default is 2017.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt Year(varname numeric)}: specifies the year variable for the analysis.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt setting(string)}: Optional. If GMD option is specified, harmonized variables are created, and additional options (hhhead(), edu(), married(), school(), services(), assets(), hhsize(), hhid(), pid(), industrycat4(), lstatus(), and empstat()) do not need to be specified.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt excel(string)}: specifies the file path for exporting results to Excel.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt save(string)}: specifies the file path for saving results.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt noequalspacing}: Optional. When specified, figures show gaps between years on the x-axis proportional to their distance. Default is to display constant gaps between years, regardless of how far away years are. 
This can be useful if gaps between survey-years are large.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt yrange}: Optional. Users can specify the range of the y-axis of the figures here. The range must be entered in Stata figure format, such as "yrange(0(10)100)".
Default is that figures start at 0 and go up to the maximum value of the displayed data (next 10; or next 5 for Figure 10a).

{p 4 4 2}
{opt bar}: Optional. Users can specify this option to display Figures 1, 9a and 10a as bar graphs instead of line graphs. Warning: All selected years will be shown in the figures, regardless of whether they are comparable or not. 

{p 4 4 2}
{opt scheme(string)}: Optional. Sets the scheme, specifying the overall look of the figures. 
Default is “white_tableau”.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt palette(string)}: Optional. Sets the color palette for figures. Default is “tab20”. 
See Annex 1: Example. Either string (e.g. vividis) or list of colors.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt welfaretype(string)}: Optional. Can be used to specify whether the survey uses income or consumption to calculate welfare. 
Figures showing scatters of inequality display different symbols for countries with consumption or income aggregates. Either CONS or INC.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt relativechange}: This option affects only Figure 12: When specified, changes in mean welfare and changes in inequality are presented relative to changes in the prosperity gap. This means that the contributions will add up to 100%. The default is that the contributions are not presented in relative terms, and the addition of the two equal the change in the prosperity gap.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt idpl(varname numeric)}: This option affects only Figure 4: If national poverty lines are different within one year, specify the variable grouping the poverty lines here. This is relevant for the Shorrocks-Kolenikov decomposition. Example: idpl(urban).

{p 4 4 2}
{opt earnage(integer)}: specifies the age cut-off for working status for the economic composition. Working status depends both on labor force status (lstatus) and employment status (empstat). Individuals will only be considered working if as old or older than the cut-off.
