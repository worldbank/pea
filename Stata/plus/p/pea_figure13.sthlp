{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{opt pea figure13} generates a graphical visualization of welfare distribution by deciles over specified years or comparability groups. This includes the visualization of survey-based welfare shares for different welfare deciles through spike charts or area charts, depending on the temporal structure of the data.

{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt ONEWelfare(varname numeric)}:
Specifies the numeric welfare variable to analyze and visualize. 

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt Year(varname numeric)}:
The year variable used for grouping comparisons over time. 
  
{p 4 4 2}
{opt PPPyear(integer)}: specifies which year PPPs are based on (e.g. 2017 or 2011).
Default is 2017.

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt NOOUTPUT}:
Suppresses generating output during analysis, typically useful during batch processing.

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt NOEQUALSPACING}: Adjusts year spacing on x-axis to be proportional to the distance between years. Default is that years are evenly spaced in the visualization.

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt excel(string)}:
Path to an existing Excel file to export the visualization results.

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt save(string)}:
Path where the visualization output will be stored.

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt scheme(string)}:
Specifies the color scheme to be used for visual contrast.

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt palette(string)}:
Defines the palette of colors to use in graphs.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt comparability(varname numeric)}: Recommended: This variable denotes which survey rounds are comparable over time. 
Non-comparable survey rounds are not connected in figures. Example:	comparability(comparability).
