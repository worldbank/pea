{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt pea table2} calculates poverty rate and share of poor by area and admin1 regions. Indicators include: poverty rates, share of poor, and number of poor disaggregated by urban and rural regions, as well as admin1 regions (both at international and national poverty lines).

{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt NATWelfare(varname numeric)}:
 specifies the variable representing welfare levels in natural (non-adjusted) terms.
  
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt NATPovlines(varlist numeric)}:
 specifies a list of natural (non-adjusted) poverty lines for analysis.
  
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt PPPWelfare(varname numeric)}:
 specifies the variable for welfare levels adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP).
  
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt PPPPovlines(varlist numeric)}:
 provides a list of poverty lines adjusted for PPP.
  
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt FGTVARS using(string)}:
 allows specifying an external file to load existing FGT variables.

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt using(string)}:
 specifies the dataset to use; the dataset will be loaded if provided.
 
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt Year(varname numeric)}:
 specifies the variable representing the year of observation.
  
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt byind(varlist)}:
 specifies one or more variables by which to group the data when calculating statistics.


 {p 4 4 2}
{opt minobs(numlist)}: specifies the minimum number of observations required to display a cell value.

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt setting(string)}: Optional. If GMD option is specified, harmonized variables are created, and additional options 
(hhhead(), edu(), married(), school(), services(), assets(), hhsize(), hhid(), pid(), industrycat4(), lstatus(), and empstat()) do not need to be specified. 
 
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt LINESORTED}:
 ensures that poverty lines are processed in sorted order if specified.
  
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt excel(string)}:
 specifies the file path for the Excel output. If omitted, a temporary file is created.
  
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt save(string)}:
 provides a file path to save intermediate data.
  
{p 4 4 2} 
{opt MISSING}:
 enables handling of missing data in categorical variables, assigning a custom label for missing values.

{title:Details}

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt pea table2} organizes poverty statistics by calculating FGT (Foster-Greer-Thorbecke) poverty measures.When grouped by different categories, it computes the poverty rate, the number of poor, and their share within each group. The program can use either natural or PPP-adjusted welfare measures depending on the options selected.

{p 4 4 2} 
After calculating poverty indicators, {opt pea table2} reshapes the data, labels the results, and organizes the final  output. This ensures that poverty indicators are grouped and easily interpretable.

{title:Example}

{p 4 4 2} 
To generate a poverty indicators table using national and PPP welfare variables with defined poverty lines, grouped by region and exported to an Excel file:

{p 4 4 2} 
{bf:pea table2} [aw=weight_p], natw(welfare) natp(natline natline2) pppw(welfppp) pppp(pline365 pline215  pline685) year(year) byind(urban subnatvar) minobs(100)
