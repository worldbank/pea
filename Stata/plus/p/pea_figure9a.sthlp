{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{opt pea figure9a} generates inequality line plots of Gini index, Theil index, Palma (Kuznets) ratio, and Welfare share of the top 20%, over time .
These plots visualize trends in inequality and allow comparisons over time. This program includes options for comparability adjustments, Excel exports, and plotting options such as visual adjustments.

{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt ONEWelfare(varname numeric)}: specifies the name of the welfare variable (income or consumption) to compute the GINI index from.  
      
{p 4 4 2}  
{opt Year(varname numeric)}: specifies the variable indicating the years across which trends will be plotted.
   
{p 4 4 2}
{opt PPPyear(integer)}: specifies which year PPPs are based on (e.g. 2017 or 2011).
Default is 2017.
   
{p 4 4 2}
{opt comparability(varname numeric)}: Recommended: This variable denotes which survey rounds are comparable over time. 
Non-comparable survey rounds are not connected in figures. Example:	comparability(comparability).
    
{p 4 4 2}  
{opt NOEQUALSPACING}: Optional. Adjusts year spacing on x-axis to be proportional to the distance between years. Default is that years are evenly spaced in the visualization.
    
{p 4 4 2}
{opt yrange}: Optional. Users can specify the range of the y-axis. The range must be entered in Stata figure format, such as "yrange(0(10)100)". Note that the Palma (Kuznets) ratio is shown on the second y-axis with a range from 0-10. It will always be 1/10 of the specified yrange.
Default is that figures start at 0 and go up to the maximum value of the displayed data (next 10).

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt ineqind(string)}: Optional. Users can specify which inequality indicators to show. Entry options are Gini Theil Palma Top20. Default are all four. 
    
{p 4 4 2}
{opt bar}: Optional. Users can specify this option to display the figure as a bar graph instead of line graph. Note that bar graphs only allow for one y-axis, so the Palma (Kuznets) ratio is multiplied by 10 for visibility. Warning: All selected years will be shown in the figures, regardless of whether they are comparable or not.
	
{p 4 4 2}  
{opt scheme(string)}: Optional. Allows users to specify visual color themes for plots.
    
{p 4 4 2}  
{opt palette(string)}: Optional. Allows custom palette settings for visualizations to better highlight inequality trends.

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt excel(string)}: Optional. Allows exporting the GINI trends plot data to the specified Excel file.
    
{p 4 4 2}  
{opt save(string)}: Optional. Saves the generated plot trends as a Stata dataset or file.
